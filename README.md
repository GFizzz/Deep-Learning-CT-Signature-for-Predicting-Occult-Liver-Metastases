# Deep-Learning-CT-Signature-for-Predicting-Occult-Liver-Metastases

## Introduction

This repository accompanies our research on using deep learning to develop a CT-based signature for predicting occult liver metastases. The method is designed to assist in identifying patients at high risk of metastasis, potentially enabling earlier interventions and improved treatment planning.
