# Deep-Learning-CT-Signature-for-Predicting-Occult-Liver-Metastases

## Introduction

This repository accompanies our research on using deep learning to develop a CT-based signature for predicting occult liver metastases. The method is designed to assist in identifying patients at high risk of metastasis, potentially enabling earlier interventions and improved treatment planning.

## 🔧 Project Status

Thank you for your interest in this project!  
The project is still under active development, and we are progressively releasing the codebase.

- ✅ **Partially released**: Some components of the code are now available.
- ⏳ **In preparation**: Full code will be released after the associated paper is officially accepted.
- 📌 **Current release**: The **network architecture** can be found in: network/network_liver_metastases.py


Please note that the repository may undergo significant updates. We advise against using the current version in production or clinical applications until the official release.
