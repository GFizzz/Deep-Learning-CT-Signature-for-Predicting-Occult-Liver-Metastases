# Deep-Learning-CT-Signature-for-Predicting-Occult-Liver-Metastases

## 0. Introduction

This repository accompanies our research on using deep learning to develop a CT-based signature for predicting occult liver metastases. The method is designed to assist in identifying patients at high risk of metastasis, potentially enabling earlier interventions and improved treatment planning.

## 3. Instructions for Use & Demo

### Data collection

Due to privacy issues, you need to collect multi-phase CECT images (arterial phase, venous phase, delay phase) by yourself.

We will put the preprocessed images demo in the data directory "data/"

#### Labels File Format

Patient labels are stored in an Excel file located in the `data/` directory.

- The Excel file (e.g., `labels.xlsx`) contains two columns:
  - **First column**: Patient ID (must match the folder names in `data/`)
  - **Second column**: Label (`0` or `1`), where:
    - `0` = Negative for occult liver metastases
    - `1` = Positive for occult liver metastases

### Preprocessing Instructions

Refering to the preprocessing pipeline of **nnU-Net** (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet).  
Each phase of the contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images is individually preprocessed to generate 3D full-resolution `.npy` files (`3d_fullres`).

After preprocessing, for each phase, the corresponding CT image is element-wise multiplied by its tumor mask and liver mask to extract the tumor region and liver region. This results in one `.npy` file per phase representing the tumor area and liver area only.
Then, organize the files as follows:
```text
data/

â”œâ”€â”€ PancreasTumor/

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ arteria/

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient01.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient02.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ venous/

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient01.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient02.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ delayed/

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient01.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ patient02.npy

â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...

â”œâ”€â”€ Liver/

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```
### Training 

When the pre-processing and data preparing process is done, we can train our model.

We mainly use the pre-processed data from last step: 

- **phase1_dir = "data/PancreasTumor/arteria/"**

- **phase2_dir = "data/PancreasTumor/venous/"**

- **phase3_dir = "data/PancreasTumor/delayed/"**

- **liver_phase1_dir = "data/Liver/arteria/"**

- **liver_phase2_dir = "data/Liver/venous/"**

- **liver_phase3_dir = "data/Liver/delayed/"**

- **label_file = "data/label.xlsx"**

```bash 
python train.py
```

The training results and models are saved in: **"logs/model/"**




### Inference 

When we have trained our models, we can inference all the data in testing set.

```bash 
python inference.py
```

When this process is done, the prediction results will be put in **"test_results/"** as an `.xlsx` files.

### Demo: Inference patients with no label 

```bash 
python inference_nolabel.py
```
